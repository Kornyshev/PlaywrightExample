## Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven
- Dependencies

## This project includes the following key dependencies
- Playwright
- JUnit 5
- Allure for test reporting

## Running Tests

## Understanding the Tests
Tests are written using the JUnit 5 framework. The TodoMainPageTests class provides examples of basic operations such as adding, completing, and deleting todos using the Page Object Model pattern to interact with the TodoMVC app.

## Key Features Demonstrated
- Implementation of the Page Object Model pattern
- Custom element handling with Playwright in Java
- Use of assertions to verify web interactions
